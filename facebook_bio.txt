All I have are dreams. No one else would believe it. No one else can see. No one else but me
Don't judge me till you know me. Don't underestimate me when you test me 
I'm not going to fail since a valuable lesson has been learned even in failure, and it's helping me grow
I am not afraid of death; I am scared of not trying 
God can judge and compel me to leave; either love me or abandon me
I wish Facebook would alert me when someone has deleted me. I might love it that way
I'm so open-minded that my brain may fall out
I used to have a life until someone asked me to make a Facebook profile
I was formally diagnosed with FOTD (Facebook Obsessive Testing Disorder)
I was told that I was beyond therapy. Just pray for me. Don't hold me back! And I know that I can play better than you
Ignore me, poke me, like me, and constrain me. You have the choice. Welcome to Facebook, where no one else can be your friend
Love me? Amazing. Hate me, huh? Perhaps worse. Don't you remember me? Make no judgment of me!
I'm blessed with a funny gene that will make my life enjoyable
My brain is divided into two parts: Right & left. Nothing is left in Right. Nothing in Right in left
My BACK isn't a VOICEMAIL, so say it on my FACE. It's much more comfortable
I don't like myself; I'm too mad for myself
Facebook is more of a prison. You spend the entire day staring at the walls and being poked by strangers
I'm not shy, holding back my gorgeousness and not bullying you
I don't have two personalities, separate. I am exactly what I am
I'm just a cupcake in need of a stud muffin
God is really creative; I mean, just look at me
I am my own secretary; I dictate, I compose, I copy all myself
I am gentle, but it doesn't mean I'm stupid
I'm not one to defend myself very often. I let my actions speak for themselves
Work hard in silence; let your success be your noise
